=================================

### 1. Definitions

"Work" means the software, machine learning model weights, datasets, documentation, and associated materials this license is applied to, or any portion thereof.

"Source Form" means the form of a work preferred for making modifications.

"Processed Form" means any form of a work other than Source Form, such as object code, bytecode, or minified code.

"Derivative Work" means any of the following:

"Covered Work" means the Work or any Derivative Work, in Source or Processed Form, in every case including portions thereof.

"Larger Work" means any work that combines Covered Work with other material that is not Covered Work, so long as the other material is kept in separate files from the Covered Work. Conversion of a Larger Work into Processed Form will not cause that Larger Work to become Covered Work.

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of the Work, to deal in the Work without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, perform publicly, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Work, and to permit persons to whom the Work is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

- a) For Permitted Entities:
    - i) When distributing Covered Work in Source Form, it must be licensed under this Cooperative License.
    - ii) When distributing Covered Work in Processed Form, it may be licensed under terms of your choosing; however, the recipient may only be granted the right to further distribute the work under this Cooperative License.
- b) For Restricted Entities:
    - i) When distributing Covered Work in any form, including as part of a Larger Work and/or via remote interaction through a computer network, the Covered Work must be made available in Source Form at no charge and licensed under this Cooperative License.
- c) For Everyone:
    - i) When distributing Covered Work subject to this Cooperative License, an unmodified copy of this license must accompany that distribution.
    - ii) When distributing Covered Work subject to this Cooperative License, no additional permissions or restrictions may be applied to the Covered Work.
    - iii) When distributing Covered Work, you are free to offer your own support, warranty, or indemnity, so long as you make clear that such obligation applies only to you and not to any other person or organization who has contributed to the Covered Work.
    - iv) Notwithstanding the above restrictions, Covered Work may be distributed and licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License Version 3 (AGPLv3), instead of this Cooperative License. If you exercise this option and the Covered Work is part of a Larger Work, the Larger Work must also be licensed under the AGPLv3.
